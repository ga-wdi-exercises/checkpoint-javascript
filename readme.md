# JavaScript Checkpoint

## Before You Start

The test suite is located in `./test`. **Before you begin anything, run `npm install`.**

To run the tests in the terminal, run `npm test`. Every time you make a change and save your files, you will need to manually re-run the tests. When you start, all of the tests will be failing; your goal is to make as many pass as you can in the hour provided.

> HINT: read the output of the failing tests.

## Instructions

This checkpoint is divided into three sections:

- Fundamentals in `fundamentals.js`
- Higher-order Functions in `hof.js`
- Object Oriented JavaScript in `oojs.js`

Each section has a series of prompts written in inline-comments. Write the JavaScript necessary to complete each prompt.

**Make a commit after you complete each section.**

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to use the `var` keyword for **ALL** variable declarations (for testing purposes). **DO NOT** use `const` or `let`.

## Submission

Fork this repository and clone your fork locally. Commit as you go. When you are finished, push to GitHub.

**Wait until the end of the hour to make your Pull Request**
