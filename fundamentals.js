// NOTE: Make sure to use the `var` keyword for ALL variable declarations.

// #1: Create an array of strings called `foods` that contains three foods.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var foods = ['mango' + 'orange' + 'peach']



// #2: Access the last item in the array and assign to a variable called `last`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
console.log(foods[2])
foods.push('last')



// #3: Create an empty array called `favoriteFoods`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var favoriteFoods = []


// #4: Create a `for` loop that adds each string in `foods` to `favoriteFoods`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    console.log(i)
  }


// #5: Create an object literal called `instructor` that contains three key-value pairs.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

var instructor = {
    firstName: 'Jane',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    subject: 'English'
};

// #6: Add a `has-office-hours` (spelled exactly) property to `instructor` by accessing
// it (do not change the original object you typed above) and assigning it
// a boolean value.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
instructor.age = "50";
