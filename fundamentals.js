// NOTE: Make sure to use the `var` keyword for ALL variable declarations.

// #1: Create an array of strings called `foods` that contains three foods.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
 var foods = ["noodles", "soups", "dumplings"]


// #2: Access the last item in the array and assign to a variable called `last`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
 var last = foods[2]


// #3: Create an empty array called `favoriteFoods`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
 var favoriteFoods = [];

// #4: Create a `for` loop that adds each string in `foods` to `favoriteFoods`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

for (i = 0; i < foods.length < i++) {
    push.foods(favoriteFoods[i])
}
// Stephanie logic: I think this is saying that let's start at the beginning aka i=0 or position where index = 0 which is the beginning. So iterate through the length of foods array and increase in single increments. I think I'm then saying for this iteration, push contents of foods into the empty variable favoriteFoods. I think I'm saying this by putting this i in favoriteFoods[i]...saying continue to spit out the new value at the new index position?

// #5: Create an object literal called `instructor` that contains three key-value pairs.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

var instructor = {
    name: "Hector",
    cohort: "wdi24",
    subject: "web dev immersive"
}

// #6: Add a `has-office-hours` (spelled exactly) property to `instructor` by accessing
// it (do not change the original object you typed above) and assigning it
// a boolean value.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

instructor.push(['has-office-hours': true])
Object.addKey
// I don't remember the syntax here. I do recognize we need to use the special method to add the key value... I think it is object.addKey("has-office-hours") and then for the property was object.addProperty(true). I remember mentioning in readMe and class that for properties it should look something like ([]) to differentiate..but .... other than that...lost
