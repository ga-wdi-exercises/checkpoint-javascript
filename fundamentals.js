// NOTE: Make sure to use the `var` keyword for ALL variable declarations.

// #1: Create an array of strings called `foods` that contains three foods.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var foods = ['lamb', 'steak', 'potatoes']
console.log(foods)


// #2: Access the last item in the array and assign to a variable called `last`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var last = foods[foods.length -1]
console.log(last)


// #3: Create an empty array called `favoriteFoods`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var favoriteFoods = []


// #4: Create a `for` loop that adds each string in `foods` to `favoriteFoods`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:



// #5: Create an object literal called `instructor` that contains three key-value pairs.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var instructor = {
  wdi20: ['mike', 'ali', 'james', 'max', 'zach'],
  primaryLanguage: ['JavaScript', 'Python', 'PHP'],
  priorTeachingExperience: ['yes', 'no'],
  
  consolelog(instructor)
}



// #6: Add a `has-office-hours` (spelled exactly) property to `instructor` by accessing

instructor.push('has-office-hours')
console.log(foods)
