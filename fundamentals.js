// NOTE: Make sure to use the `var` keyword for ALL variable declarations.

// #1: Create an array of strings called `foods` that contains three foods.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var foods = ['pizza', 'tacos', 'burgers']
// #2: Access the last item in the array and assign to a variable called `last`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
foods[2]

// #3: Create an empty array called `favoriteFoods`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var favoriteFoods = []
// #4: Create a `for` loop that adds each string in `foods` to `favoriteFoods`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
for (var index = 0; index < foods.length; index++) {
  var favoriteFoods = ['pizza', 'tacos', 'burgers' ];
}
// #5: Create an object literal called `instructor` that contains three key-value pairs.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var instructor = {
  name: 'Person',
  age: '72',
  location: 'Mars'
}
// #6: Add a `has-office-hours` (spelled exactly) property to `instructor` by accessing
// it (do not change the original object you typed above) and assigning it
// a boolean value.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
instructor.hours = 'has-office-hours'
