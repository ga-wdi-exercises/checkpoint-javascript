// NOTE: Make sure to use the `var` keyword for ALL variable declarations.

// #1: Create an array of strings called `foods` that contains three foods.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var foods = ['hamburger', 'subs','hoogie']
//in this I listed 3 foods



// #2: Access the last item in the array and assign to a variable called `last`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
//from here I want to assign 'hoogie' as the last food item 

var hoogie = 'last'



// #3: Create an empty array called `favoriteFoods`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var favoriteFoods = ['','','','']
//this what I assume is what I am supposed to be doing
// wasn't too sure about 

// #4: Create a `for` loop that adds each string in `foods` to `favoriteFoods`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
// here at this point I am actaully lost
// can't conceptualize this or the loop


// #5: Create an object literal called `instructor` that contains three key-value pairs.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var instructor = {
 class: WDI,
 subject: js,
 style: comedic
}
//I think this is what I was supposed to do? 



// #6: Add a `has-office-hours` (spelled exactly) property to `instructor` by accessing
// it (do not change the original object you typed above) and assigning it
// a boolean value.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
//I am not 100% what to do on this
