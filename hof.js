// #1: Use the `map` array method to create a new array containing the names of each
// person in the `people` array. Assign the returned array to a variable
// called `peopleNames`.

//Then I need to assign that array to a variable called 'peopleNames'


function grabNames() {
  i = people.getElementById("name")

for(let i = 0; i < people.length; i++){
  console.log(map[i])
}

var map = peopleNames

// #2: Use the `filter` array method to create a new, filtered array containing only
// persons from the `people` array who know multiple languages. Assign the returned array
// to a variable called `polyglotPeople`.
