// #1: Use the `map` array method to create a new array containing the names of each
// person in the `people` array. Assign the returned array to a variable
// called `peopleNames`.

var people = [
  {name: "Keanu", age: 54},
  {name: "Layla", age: 27},
  {name: "Jasmine", age: 35}

// #2: Use the `filter` array method to create a new, filtered array containing only
// persons from the `people` array who know multiple languages. Assign the returned array
// to a variable called `polyglotPeople`.
