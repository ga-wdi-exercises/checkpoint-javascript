// NOTE: Make sure to use the `var` keyword for ALL variable declarations

// #1: Define a `Playlist` class with the following properties:
// - a `title` property that is a string determined by some input (passed into the constructor)
// - a `songs` property that is an empty array not determined by input (not passed into the constructor)
// - an `addSong` method that adds a song (string) to the `songs` array
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

var playlist = [
  {
      title: "Prince",
      songs: "Im Yours",
},

// *I do not remember the correct syntax I will need to study more on this and try again on the retake.


// #2: Create an instance of the Playlist class and set it to a variable called `myPlaylist`
// Call the instance's `addSong` method to add a song to the instance's `songs` array
// Type your solution immediately below this line:

// *I do not remember the correct syntax I will need to study more on this and try again on the retake.



// NOTE: THE CODE BELOW IS FOR TESTING PURPOSES. DO NOT REMOVE OR ALTER.
if(typeof Playlist !== 'undefined') {
  module.exports = {
    Playlist
  }
}
